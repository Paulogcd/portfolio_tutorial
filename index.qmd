At the end of each chapter, you will find some useful complementary resources. Here are the main ones : 

- For the first chapter, I learned a lot in [Florian Oswald class](https://floswald.github.io/ScPoProgramming/), Associate Professor of Economics at Sciences Po in Paris, and my teacher to introduction to programming.
- The second chapter takes some important elements from the [great documentation of Quarto](https://quarto.org) and on [their discussion forum on GitHub](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/discussions). 
- The last chapter is based on the guide of [GitHub Pages of GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart) and complementary research on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) to troubleshoot errors.
