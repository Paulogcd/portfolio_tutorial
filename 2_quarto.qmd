title: "2. Creating our content with Quarto"
---

{{< include warning.qmd >}}

Now that we know how to make use of Github and Visual Studio Code, we are going to use Quarto to create our website :art: !

**Quarto** is a static website generator. It is a software that allows us to create web content from human readable files.

Usually, we should learn HTML and CSS to know a bit of Web development.
Indeed, those are the languages that traditional web browsers support. 
When you go to a webpage, our web browser transforms html and css into a graphical interface, which is easier to understand for humans.
However, in recent years, a lot of static website generators have emerged, turning the creation of websites much easier.
Among the several static website generators, [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/), [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), and [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) can be cited, but they are far from being the only ones.

> This tutorial focuses on Quarto for several reasons.
First, it is easy to use.
The commands are user-friendly, and do not require much background knowledge.
Second, its file format (qmd, or "quarto markdown") allows to easily include data visualization, code and support some very useful libraries like [Shiny](https://shiny.posit.co/), that allow to create interactive web pages with data.
It makes it easy to showcase our work if you deal with data and statistical analysis with R, Python, or Julia.
It is therefore especially interesting if we are trying to build a research portfolio :sunglasses:.

## Installation of Quarto

The first step of this chapter is to download Quarto [here](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/).

![Installation page of Quarto](./resources/images/2_1_install_quarto2.png)

Once it is done, we will be able to interact with Quarto through the terminal of vscode.

## Create a Quarto project

Now that Quarto is installed, we can create a Quarto project in our folder (the one we synchronized with our online GitHub repository).
In order to do that, you can go in vscode, and enter `quarto create` in the terminal.
We will then be guided with several questions regarding the nature of the project we wish to create.
For the purpose of creating a portfolio, we are going to select `website` in the menu. 

![Creation of a project with Quarto](./resources/images/2_2_create_project_quarto.png)

After entering `quarto create`, quarto asks you different things : 

1. The nature of the Quarto environment we want to create. We have the choice between a `project` and an `extension`. We are going to choose `project`.
2. The type of our project. It gives us the choice between : 
    - default
    - website
    - blog
    - manuscript
    - book
    - confluence

    Wecould choose different kinds of projects here. For example, `default` would work well enough also. However, let's stick to `website` for the sake of simplicity.
3. Quarto then asks for the Directory you wish to create our quarto project in. Since you are already in the folder you opened with vscode, you should write a simple dot `.` and press enter.  

> The dot `.` refers to the current directory in several langages.
To understand better how a path works, I recommend consulting [this article](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_filepaths.asp).

Once the creation process is done, you will see appear in our folder several files : index.qmd, about.qmd, _quarto.yml, style.css. 

Let's take a moment to see what they do : 

1. The files with a ".css" extension are Cascading Style Sheets (css) files. Together with HTML, they are one of the main langages for web development. They are mainly responsisble for the appearance and design of websites. It is not necessary to modify them for the purpose of this tutorial, but you can inform ourself about it [on this tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/css/).
2. The files with a ".qmd" extension are quarto files. This extension stands for Quarto MarkDown. They correspond to what the future pages of our website will be. They support various langages, like traditional Markdown or $\LaTeX$. We will change our portfolio pages by modifying these pages. 
3. The files with a ".yml" extension are configuration files. We use them to set some rules that quarto will apply to generate our pages. For example, we will modify the navigation bar (or navbar) through our these files later in this chapter.

## The preview and render commands

Quarto allows us to create a properly designed website by only interacting with basic qmd files. We need however to see what results they yield. 

To see the graphical result of our qmd files, we need to use two main commands : the `quarto preview` and `quarto render` commands.

The `quarto preview` command allows to see in real time what the changes we are bringing to our qmd and yml files yield.
After entering it in the terminal console, it automatically opens a page on our default browser where you can see the graphical results of the latest saved version of our qmd and yml files.
If there is an error with our files (for example a bad configuration within our yaml file), you won't be able to see correctly the results, and an error message
will pop-up. We usually use it at the beginning of a work session, when we bring change to our portfolio. 

The `quarto render` command allows to create html and css files from our qmd and yml files. We usually use it at the end of a work session, when we are satisfied with the changes we brought to the our website.
Essentially, it does the same as the `preview` command, without opening a browser to see our changes in real time. 

Let's try to run the `quarto preview` command : 

![Running the quarto preview command on the vscode terminal.](./resources/images/2_3_quarto_preview_1.png)

You should briefly see some blue text "preparing to preview", followed by the names of our qmd files, before our default browser automatically launches itself. 

If you did not modify the basic files, you should see something like this on our web browser : 

![The graphical result of an empty quarto project.](./resources/images/2_4_quarto_preview_2.png)

Okay, we have our first graphical results ! What happened exactly here ? 
First, we entered `quarto preview`.
Quarto first transformed all our qmd files in our folder in readable files for you web browser, i.e. html and css files.
Then, it opened those html and css files with our default browser.
What we are seeing is the result of this conversion from qmd to html and css.

> We can notice that the URL of our page looks a bit different from normal websites you access.
Indeed, you should have something like "http://localhost:6986/", or any other kind of four numbers combination. 
This is because quarto is currently watching at our file, and will refresh the page as soon as any of our qmd or yaml files are changed and saved. 
Simplyt put, "localhost" means that it is our computer, and the four numbers are the port of our computer quarto is using to display the files.

> Now, our terminal is busy reading our files in the web browser. You can create a new terminal session by clicking on the "+" in vscode. 
To stop the process, we can click on our terminal and then enter `ctrl`+`c` (`command`+`c` for MacOS keyboards).

## How to modify our content

Now that we rendered the first version of our page, how do we modify its content ? 

If we want to modify the homepage of our website, we can go to the `index.qmd` file, and change directly the text. 
By default, Quarto should have filled the document with : 

```{.yml}
---
title: "Home"
---

This is a Quarto website.

To learn more about Quarto websites visit <https://quarto.org/docs/websites>.

```
That yields the previous image.


We can modify it by writting for example : 
```{.yml}
---
title: "Home"
---

Hello, I am Paulo Gugelmo, currently a first year
student of the Master of Research in Economics at Sciences Po. 
My research interests are environmental economics. 

Feel free to reach out to me at my email adress :
"paulo.gugelmocavalheirodias" followed by "@sciencespo.fr" !

```

This should yield : 

![Basic index page.](./resources/images/2_5_basic_index.png)

> We should usually avoid putting our entire email adress directly in our webpage.
Some bots are constantly scrapping webpages to get potential email adress that are later on the target of spam or fraudulous emails.


As we see, the changes are pretty straightforward. Since qmd files are basically a form of markdown file, we can use the markdown syntax for our content. 

> If you are not familiar with the markdown syntax, it is easy to understand. I encourage you to go check [some documentation](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/). 

For plain text, note that we can enter jumplines without actually rendering a jumpline. 
If we want to do a breakline, we should let at least one empty line between two text chunks. 

We are now going to cover some features of markdown.

### Titles and subtitles

If we write plain text in our qmd file, we will get normal text in our page. However, if we want to have titles and subtitles, we can use the `#` sign before it.

In this way, one `#` will yiel a title, two `#` a subtitle, etc., until the sixth level. With text filler, we could write the following code : 

```{.yml}
---
title: "Home"
---

# Title 

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit,
sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.
Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris 
nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.

## A Subtitle 

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit,
sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.
Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris 
nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.

### A subsubtitle 

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit,
sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.
Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris 
nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.

```

This would then yield : 

![Example of titles and subtitles.](./resources/images/2_6_titles.png)

It is as simple as that, and by default, Quarto creates a table of content automatically for us in the right-side of our page !

### Adding links

Now, if we want to add some link to our text, we are going to use the `[text](link)` markdown syntax.
Concretely, the text will be between square brackets `[]`, and the link we want between parenthesis `()`.

For example this code : 

```{.yml}

---
title: "Home"
---

Hello, I am Paulo Gugelmo, currently a first year student
of the
[Master of Research in Economics](https://www.sciencespo.fr/ecole-recherche/en/academics/masters/master-economics/)
at [Sciences Po](https://www.sciencespo.fr/en/). 
My research interests are environmental economics and open source !

Feel free to reach out to me at my email adress :
"paulo.gugelmocavalheirodias" followed by "@sciencespo.fr" !

```

will yield : 

![Example of links usage.](./resources/images/2_7_links.png)

And if we click on the links, we should be redirected to the url we wrote ! 

### Adding documents and pictures

Now, we could also want to include some pictures in our text.
For example, some pdf of a long article we wrote or screeenshots. 

In order to do so, we are going to use the `![description](link)` markdown syntax.

In the previous example, we had url as links, that could be accessed on internet. 
Now, let's imagine that we have a pdf file in our computer that we want to share on our portfolio. 
Usually, such a pdf is not available online on a public url. 

The first step we want to do is put the files we want to share in our folder in vscode. We should have something like that : 

![A vscode folder with files that we want to share.](./resources/images/2_8_vscode_files.png)

Note that in the left side of my screen, in the explorer bar, I now have to additional files : "screenshot.png" and "2_8_markdown_guide.pdf". 

If we want to include them, we could write : 

```{.yml}
---
title: "Home"
---

at [Sciences Po](https://www.sciencespo.fr/en/). 
My research interests are environmental economics and open source !

Here is an interesting website :

![A screenshot of the CRAN website.](screenshot.png)

Here is an interesting guide : 

![This is the Markdown guide, written by Matt Cone.](2_8_markdown_guide.pdf)

Feel free to reach out to me at my email adress :
"paulo.gugelmocavalheirodias" followed by "@sciencespo.fr" !

```

This code would yield : 

![An attempt to include pictures and pdf](./resources/images/2_9_including_documents.png)

We see that the picture, a screenshot of the CRAN website, seems to work fine. 
However, the markdown guide, written by Matt Cone, and [available here](https://markdown.p2hp.com/assets/book/markdown-guide.pdf), is displayed in a smaller dimension than the page. 
This is due to the fact that we are trying to include a pdf as a picture. 
To include a pdf, we can thus use the normal link syntax, while directing to the emplacement of our pdf file.
In this way, a syntax similar to `You can read the markdown guide of Matt Conen [by clicking on this link](2_8_markdown_guide.pdf)` would work better. 
We could thus write : 

```{.yml}
---
title: "Home"
---

```

That would yield : 

![Including a pdf document through a local link.](./resources/images/2_10_including_documents_2.png)

And if we click on the link, we are redirected to the pdf file within our browser. 

For the case of a portfolio, we could for example include our CV in this fashion. 

### Adding code 

Now, we might want to include code snippets in our portfolio. 
For example, we have a project for which we wrote in R or any other languages, and we want to make the code easily accessible by our visitors. 

In order for us to do that, we have two options. Either we want to include code inline, in which way we write our code between those reversed ticks (or "backticks") : ``, or we want to include a code snippet, that has several lines,
in which case we write three reversed ticks at the beginning and at the end of our code like this : 
````
```{{r}}
print("Hello world !")
```

````

The code will yield : 

```{r}
print("Hello world !")
```

**We are here touching one of the biggest strength of Quarto.**
Despite being a "simple" static website generator, it allows us to include and execute code in our page.
This can be very useful to display work that requires data treatment and/or other statistical computations. 

For example, the following code in R : 

````
```{{r}}
data(iris) # load the freely accessible dataset named "iris"
summary(iris) # display a simple statistical summary of this dataset
model = lm(iris$Sepal.Length ~ iris$Petal.Length)
# create a linear model trying to explain the sepal length by the petal length

plot(x = iris$Petal.Length,
  y = iris$Sepal.Length, 
  xlab = "Petal Length",
  ylab = "Sepal Length") # plot those two variables
abline(model) # draw the linear regression line on the plot
```
````

Will generate : 

```{r}
data(iris) # load the freely accessible dataset named "iris"
summary(iris) # display a simple statistical summary of this dataset
model = lm(iris$Sepal.Length ~ iris$Petal.Length)
# create a linear model trying to explain the sepal length by the petal length

plot(x = iris$Petal.Length,
  y = iris$Sepal.Length, 
  xlab = "Petal Length",
  ylab = "Sepal Length") # plot those two variables
abline(model) # draw the linear regression line on the plot
```

> If you don't use R, don't worry, Quarto also support several other languages, such as Python, Julia, and Observable JavaScript.
In theory, if you know how to deal with code engine, you can also run other languages on Quarto. 

### Adding math 

Finally, it's also possible to add some math to our website.
Indeed, markdown supports $\LaTeX$, so if you are already familiar with it, you can simply include our $\LaTeX$ code between dollar signs `$ some math $` to generate inline math, or between two dollar signs `$$ an equation $$` to generate math blocks. 

For example, the following code : 

```{.md}
The arithmetic mean $\bar{x}$ is defined as : 

$$
\bar{x}=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}x_{i}
$$

```

will produce : 

The arithmetic mean $\bar{x}$ is defined as : 

$$
\bar{x}=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}x_{i}
$$

If you are not familiar with $\LaTeX$ and will be in positions where you have to write documents with math in it, I highly recommend you familiarizing ourself with this language.
The [Overleaf website](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Learn_LaTeX_in_30_minutes) is a good place to start, and [this guide here](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX) is very complete.

## How to modify the navigation bar

Now that we are more proefficient in the generation of content, we can talk about the aspect of our portfolio. 
Without being website designers, we can recognize that an essential element of any website is the navigation bar.
In Quarto, it is automatically displayed in all our pages, and we can only modify it in our `_quarto.yml` file. By default, we should have something similar to this :

```{.yml}
project:
  type: website

website:
  title: "."
  navbar:
    left:
      - href: index.qmd
        text: Home
      - about.qmd

format:
  html:
    theme: cosmo
    css: styles.css
    toc: true
```

That yields a navbar like : 

![The default navbar of Quarto](./resources/images/2_11_default_navbar.png)

In this example, the content of the navigation bar, or "navbar", are determined by all elements following the `navbar` element in the `website` list.
Here, we see that it has two elements : the homepage, defined as the index.qmd file, and the about page, defined as the `about.qmd` file.

Normally, the title of our page should appear in our browser, despite not being specified in our navbar.
This is the default setting of Quarto.
To unable this option, we can add `title: false` in our `navbar` list : 

```{.yml}
website:
  title: "."
  navbar:
    title: false
    left:
      - href: index.qmd
        text: Home
      - about.qmd
```

This should yield : 

![A navbar without title.](./resources/images/2_12_without_title.png)

We may however want to keep it. in this case, it should be better to modify the title of our webpage to a customed one, like our name.
For example, in my case : 

```{.yml}
website:
  title: "Paulo Gugelmo Cavalheiro Dias"
  navbar:
    left:
      - href: index.qmd
        text: Home
      - about.qmd
```

Now, to add a new page to our navbar, we can add an element in the `left` or `right` list such as : 

```{.yml}
website:
  title: "Paulo Gugelmo Cavalheiro Dias"
  navbar:
    left:
      - href: index.qmd
        text: Home
      - projects.qmd
      - about.qmd
```

For this configuration to work, we must first create a `projects.qmd` file beforehand in our folder.
This will then implement a new link in the navbar, displayed in its left part, having for name the title of the file, i.e. here `Projects` : 

```{.yml}
---
title: "Projects"
--- 

Welcome to my projects webpage. You will find here a list of ongoing or past projects I worked on. 

```

If we now combine the two mentioned code, we should have something like : 

::: {#New-doc-navbar layout-ncol=2}

![Our vscode interface.](./resources/images/2_13_vscode.png)

![The graphical result.](./resources/images/2_14_navbar.png)

Adding a new document to the navbar
:::

## Output directory

A final important point for the publication of our website in the last chapter is the out-put directory.

In order for us to configure the output directory, we are going to change our _quarto.yml to add the `output-dir` line :

```{.yml}
project:
  type: website
  output-dir: docs
```

This line tells Quarto to create a subdirectory called "docs" to store the html and css files. 
It is important to specify this so that Github Pages recognize more easily our files to publish them.

Therefore, make sure to add this line, run `quarto render`, and check that the "docs" directory is created in your folder.

## Further resources

At this point, we roughly covered the basics of Quarto.
Although not complete, our portfolio is functional.
If you wish to dive further into the personalization of our website (which is probably the case), you can spend more time reading their documentation. 

Quarto is a very powerful tool.
We can use it to quickly produce content and maintain it with the presented workflow in this tutorial.
I highly recommend the reading of their [documentation here](https://quarto.org/docs/guide/), and more specifically to follow through their [Get Started guide](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/).
